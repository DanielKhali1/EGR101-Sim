Just finished the design for a TCP Networking application that will connect 
Unity and Java together I got it to work with a controller in java that can move
a cube in Unity. commited it to the main on github.

September 13th 2021
Worked on PBL, UML, and sprint breakdown with team.

September 14th 2021
created a small mockup for the BotDesign GUI to give to Keely.
created the initial file setup, added the BaseArduino, Pin, and Pintype classes
did a bit more file setup adding the Pin, Widget, and Servo motor classes

September 15th 2021
Keely made a BotDesign GUI mockup and I gave feedback on it
Created the initial UI for an IDE with a textArea that 
I could shoot strings in to be translated to Java code
added the JOOR API to allow us to compile at runtime
(for adding code translating it and compiling at runtime)

Septermber 16th 2021
did a lot of Pin support added Analog Digital PinState PinType,
and ArduinoBehavior Manager classes to project.
ight need an overhaul eventually because apparently 
you can read and write digitally or analog from any pin which 
(I assume) would mean we should test the behavior of that on an actual arduino
added translator class (doesn't work)

September 17th 2021
still working on the ArduinoBehaviorManager which should facilitate the
Translation and compilation of code to a javaclass at runtime
Finally got Translation to work so that we can code in arduino and it will build
to a java class that can execute commands on the base arduino class

September 18th 2021
Added more translator updates

September 19th 2021
I need to test components so I'm going to be making an in house Wiring GUI
added PNGs of LED, Arduino.
Wrote a ton of code getting wiring GUI to work you can point and click on pins to
drag out wires to other components.

September 20th 2021
Fixed a bug with the wiring code

September 22nd 2021
Fixed the actual bug with the wiring code
Created the application Manager 
Created and added the SDS and SRS 
Merged Lukes work into main

September 23rd 2021
Widgets are now called components
Added a ton of issues to the Github tool to track tickets and stuff
Added the PBL
worked on the SRS

September 27th 2021
Re-setup Base Simulation by creating a SimulationManager class
ripped up old Pin abstraction setup

September 28th 2021
worked more on the SDS

September 29th 2021
worked even more on Software Design Documents

October 1st 2021
I'm still building the simulation design
final document update should be good to submit
I merged Keelys branch into me

October 4th 2021
Just did a massive commit from the last few days that modified 27 different classes and added 2 classes
This commit allows for the Wiring GUI I made a while back to add an LED and a resistor, wire them to an arduino
fully through the GUI and then code it with the IDE we have. it follows digital writes and follows delays like real life arduino

October 5th
took some gifs for the 1st demo of the semester
cleaned up A LOT of code, removed warnings, removed redundant code
merged my branch in to main
also added a shutdown process that kills the simulation thread when the simulation is over.
helped keely add RichTextFX to the project directory and link it to the build path

October 14th
spotted a bug with compiling multiple times, it seems to short my memory...
got a blue screen of death from it while testing :(

October 17th
fixed an error with the compile class from the JOOR Library, we can now compile as many times as we'd like,
the instance of the created translation behavior will add an index to the end of the class name so we don't recompile
the same class over and over again

October 18th
added Serial and Servo classes to act as references we can access fromt he IDE. When people code they can access
these libraries to get Servo motors working or to print. Each of these classes are taken basically verbatum from 
the Arduino reference website
added a testplan document to our directory and worked on that for a bit today as well

October 19th
JDK is a real pain in the ass to keep reconfiguring each time someone hands off the project so I linked it
straight to the project folder so our project now has jdk pre-packaged within it.

October 20th 
added more edits to Testplan
also merged alot of working branches together in main

October 25th
added a ton of components now that the Serial and Servo library is finished I think the 
plan will be to work on Servo motors first then IR then distnace then finally ultrasonic

October 26th 
added edits to the SRS
worked all day on getting the Servo motor to function (1 in the display) and (2 in the simulation)
finally spins but it looks ugly.

October 27th 
can now control the spin with code you put in to our IDE and build

October 28th
made an overhaul of all our UI elements, added new sensors and moved components around
added funciotnality so that I could delete componets and it would remove the connected wires from them
/: that does not work

November 1st
fixed the bug from the 28th
got distance measuring IR sensors to semi work,
the problem is that we have to approximate a funciton that is inherint in the design of the Distance IR sensor 
component (SHARP GP2Y0A710K0F)
I finished by eyeballing an approximate piecewise function that will approximate voltage based off of distance
calculations are as follows
-29.053 + 9.35(y/22)^(1/-1.32) = x from 15 to 80
y = 0.235x from 0 to 10
y = 1.35 + 0.1x from 10 to 15
checking against other code bases this seems to be more than sufficient to approximate voltages
based on (https://gist.github.com/reefwing/6bb74409774d5152f904)

November 4th
added ultrasonic things and made it work

November 5th
Think I might move to help the others with Unity related things. 
I added models that Vivian created, to the Unity project
added these models to the scene Luke and Emily were working on and constructed the models to look like a boe-bot

November 9th
added the Sprint Demo 2 powerpoint to the repo

November 15th
began picking up some slack for the BotDesign stuff
started working on getting the bot to rotate with a mouse drag

November 16th
it rotates now when you drag over the model

November 17th
created a GUI that has a dropdown that you can select boe-bot components to drag and drop them onto the screen/
onto the bot.

November 18th
played with lighting for the Unity scene a bit. might add a skybox to this
the previous statment was a mistake so I reverted what I did

November 21st
I decided that I'll start working on the Simulation of the boe bot as to not step on other peoples toes.
So I created a new scene and started by playing with rigid bodies on the prefab we have for the boe-bot.
after a long LONG LONG LONG time getting the physics right I can now rotate specific wheels on the boe-bot
to rotate and move the bot in directions depending on the boebots wheel positioning
also created a new follow script which has the camera follow the bot

November 22nd
started wiring up the java project so that it could start the server socket that can communicate information to
the unity bot so that it will move based off of the packets send from java. This seemed to work well so I think I'll
finish for my work on this project and move to work on documentation

November 23rd
the last statement was a lie because I played with the physics a little more in the unity project
but finally started working on the SDS and SRS with vivian

--------------------------- THanks giving break -----------------

November 27th
came back from break to work on the SDS and SRS me and vivian made a shared document

November 28th
uploaded both docouments again after more work was done

November 29th
the SRS is complete but the SDS has a ton of work left
more work was done and now I believe we are finished with the SDS

November 30th
we weren't finished because my meeting with Cheng made me realize I uploaded the wrong SDS
we reuploaed the SDS again fromt the shared document so now all of our documentation is up to date.
also did a lot of merging for other members that were working to main

December 1st
just worked with the team to compile the power point for the final demo.
merged all loose ends together in the main 
(had to sort through quite a bit of merge conflicts but I think we're okay now)

--------------------------- Second Semester _-----------------------------

January 3rd
there is a bug with how our unity client receieves packets I think it overloads the client 
and stalls out, I've been testing our simulation exe and it keeps stalling after around 5 seconds of playing

January 10th
have been working on this bug for a hot second and I'm not figuring it out. I gave this to luke since I believe it might require
us to switch to UDP instead of TCP I've been adding "thread.sleep" to see if I can slow down the distribution of packets to our client as
it sends every iteration from the arduino emulation.

January 13th
more playing around with thread sleep

January 18th
did some clean up of our code

January 20th
going to start work on bot customization GUI we have a lot of work to do to add components and presets to the bot and somehow tie it in to the wiring/simulation
the idea is that we will have a mesh of points surrounding the bot that you can snap components too when you click to instantiate a component

January 22th
still working on this point mesh

January 28th
finished the point mesh and can successfully add components to it.
Unfortunately the only way to add components is to use rigidbody and rigidbodies have physics attached to them which is a gigantic pain because now they're flopping around the bot

January 30th
figured out the flopping around bug for Ultrasonic sensors will be now distributing to the distance measuring IR sensor. Also am begining to work on selecting components by highlighting them.
rotation around the bot is difficult because of the trig it involves

Febuary 1st
just added presets and modeled 4 different mounts and 4 different wheels and a new distance IR sensor so it's no longer a default sphere. added their pictures and now I'm thinking of implementing emily's
color commits to allow for color picking, as well as rotation of components as they are selected.

Feburary 3rd
added a mesh around the entire boebot that you could snap items onto 

Feburary 4th
have been fixing the UI in bot customization GUI so that it looks better

Feburary 7th
added elements to the ultra sonic sensor prefab that way it would snap better, and in doing so added a bug

Feburary 7th
fixed the bug snapping ultrasonic sensor is now working

Feburary 8th
started trying to fix threading issues that come up when closing the simulation window instead of hitting end
did a lot of work making sure that the communication ends when it is supposed to

Feburary 9th
made a small change on IR sensors and the camera swapping

Feburary 20th
started working on the component tracker ( a feature that makes changes to components known within simulations )

March 5th 
spent an entire day working on the component tracker, got mostly everything finished but I'm blocked by luke so I can't
implement the wiring configuration integration yet.

April 11th
edited the wiring scene a bit and added a better parrallax boe bot model

April 13th 
added more textures to our components and styled bot customization a little more
also started working on figuring out how to track components and wiring connections between sim and customization

April 15th (6 days ago)
more work on saving wiring connections correctly
got ir sensors working correctly between sim and customization

April 16th (5 days ago)
linereading semi works

April 17th (4 days ago)
re-worked keely's broken serial plotter so that it worked with my stuff because i needed it to
print things out to test line reading

April 18th (3 days ago)
got mounts and wheels to update in the simulation
added a course switching button to switch between stages

April 19th (2 days ago)
got distance IR and Ultrasonic sensor working in the simulation

April 20th
vivian added a new course so I updated all the peripherals for that and helped her with lighting
worked a little more on ultrasonic sensor stuff.
added final touches
started the presentation

April 21st
finished the presentation
presented the project
